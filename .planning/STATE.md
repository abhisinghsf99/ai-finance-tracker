## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4 coarse phases derived from 30 requirements; charts combined with dashboard cards in Phase 2; layout/deployment combined with foundation in Phase 1
- [Roadmap]: Chat system isolated as Phase 4 due to experimental MCP API and highest complexity
- [01-01]: Removed next-themes entirely -- dark-only app needs no theme switching infrastructure
- [01-01]: Manual TypeScript interfaces for DB types instead of supabase gen types -- simpler, no CLI dependency
- [01-02]: Anchor-only navigation -- MobileNav uses <a href="#section"> instead of Next.js Link for same-page scrolling
- [01-02]: Layout test uses source-code file reading to avoid PostCSS/vitest incompatibility

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: `experimental_createMCPClient` in AI SDK v6 is experimental -- validate MCP connection before designing chat UI in Phase 4
- [Research]: Vercel Hobby plan has 10-second timeout; MCP tool calls take 2-5 seconds -- confirm plan tier before Phase 4
- [Research]: Recurring detection needs merchant name normalization design spike in Phase 3
